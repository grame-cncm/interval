# interval
A simple interval library for the Faust compiler. 

All the code is encapsulated in the namespace 'itv'. It is organized as follows:

- interval_def.hh : defines intervals as data structures with some very basic methods to access the fields
- interval_algebra.hh/cpp: class gathering all operations on intervals as defined by Faust primitives.
- intervalXXX.cpp: implementation of the XXX operation on intervals.
